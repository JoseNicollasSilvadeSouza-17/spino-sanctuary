The **SpinoSanctuary** project is an Spinosauridae Sanctuary made using the **Move** programming language on the **Sui** blockchain for the Sui Move Brazil Bootcamp held in November (03 to 17).

The motivation for the project arose from my passion for Spinosauridae0 and the theme of zoos and sanctuaries. I found the idea of creating a sanctuary in the Web3 world fascinating, where the user can choose their favorite version of Spinosauridae and take care of it virtually.
